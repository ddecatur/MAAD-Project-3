# Media Art Design Practice: Project 3

My prompt was viewer-interactable, overwhelming, and the meme of cats in banana suits with the caption "prepare for trouble and make it double"

To view this project, first open the file index.html as a webpage (you need to do this on your own machine by downloading the code and clicking on the "index.html" file since this website is not actually hosted anywhere). Then click the banana gif each time to see it double. The point is that it's doubling quickly becomes overwhelming as it fills up the entire screen.
